# Progetto-Reti-Logiche-2022-Maestri-Longo
GRADE: 30/30
This is the final test of the course Reti Logiche at Politecnico Of Milano. The project task can be read at "PFRL_Specifica_21_22_V3" file.

The purpose is to create an FSM that simulate a convulator (in input there is one word that produces in output two words).
The project is written in vhdl.
To made this project we uesd a lot of test_benches those can test if our code could be run at every situation possible, for example with 0 words in input, 255 words in input, reading from different RAM, reading two times the same RAM, using the reset signal, ecc..

IMPORTANT: your first solution isn't the only one, you maybe can find a smarter and faster solution!
